# D3Visualization
Data Driven Documents(D3) visualisation using javascript on 100 sales data. 

Newer versions of Chrome browser will not allow to incorporate external JavaScript or data files in html page unless they are hosted on the same web server.  This means files on local computer will not work.  A simple workaround is to use a free web server such as Microsoft IIS or a multi-platform version such as Fenix Web Server.  Simply follow the default installation and then point it to the folder containing your D3 visualisation and JavaScript/Data files.
